**Welcome to my homepage**! 
<p style="font-size: 18px;">
  
My name is SUN Cho Fei (Pascal). I am currently studying MPhil in Statistics under the supervision of Professor YAU Chun Yip. My research interests focus on Extreme Value Theory, Environmental Statistics and Time Series Analysis.

Before joinning Professor YAU's team, I received my BSc in Risk Management Science from CUHK (The Chinese University of Hong Kong) with First Class Honor.

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, hiking as well as exploring different cities around the world.
